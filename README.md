# SQL_basic_course
My practice from the course "SQL Basic Level" 

In this course, I worked with:
- Functions for work with str (Such as CONCAT, TRIM, REPLACE, and etc.)
- Functions for work with numeric (Such as ROUND, ASB, RAND and etc.)
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG)
- Group operators (GROUP BY, ORDER BY)
- JOINS and UNION (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, SELF)
- Filter operators (WHERE, HAVING)
